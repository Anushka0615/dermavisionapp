## üìò Project Overview  
This project presents an AI-based system for **automated classification of human skin diseases** using deep learning.  
A lightweight **MobileNetV2** model was trained on the **ISIC 2019 dataset** to identify four common skin disease categories with **88.24 % accuracy**.  

The **DermavisionApp** web interface allows users to upload a skin image and receive instant predictions with confidence scores.  
Additional features include optional patient metadata (age, sex, medical history) and a **‚ÄúFind a Dermatologist‚Äù** locator that redirects users to Google Maps.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Build an accurate CNN-based skin disease classifier.  
- Preprocess and analyze dermatological images for feature extraction.  
- Evaluate performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  
- Deploy a real-time, user-friendly web app for diagnosis assistance.
