<!-- Global Dermatology Overview -->
<div class="insight-section">
  <h2>📊 Global Dermatology Overview</h2>
  <p>
    According to WHO, over <strong>900 million people</strong> suffer from skin-related disorders globally.
    Many of these could be prevented or treated early if detected in time. AI tools like DermaVision aim
    to assist dermatologists and general users by offering fast, preliminary evaluations.

<!-- How AI Assists in Dermatology -->
<div class="insight-section">
  <h2>🤖 How AI Assists in Dermatology</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>AI models analyze lesion images to detect potential abnormalities.</li>
    <li>Deep neural networks learn from thousands of dermatological cases for accuracy.</li>
    <li>Helps triage cases — determining if medical consultation is urgently needed.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- How It Works -->
<div class="insight-section">
  <h2>⚙️ How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    The system uses a deep learning model trained on a large curated dataset of dermatological images covering
    four major classes: <strong>MEL, NV, BCC,</strong> and <strong>BKL</strong>. The prediction combines visual
    lesion features with optional user-provided information such as age, sex, and brief medical history.
    This hybrid approach enhances precision and personal relevance in the AI’s assessment.

<!-- Research Outlook -->
<div class="insight-section">
  <h2>🔬 Research Outlook</h2>
  <p>
    Future versions of <strong>DermaVision</strong> aim to integrate broader and more diverse datasets,
    covering rare and region-specific skin conditions. The platform also plans to incorporate
    <strong>video-based lesion tracking</strong> for monitoring changes over time, enhancing the early detection
    of evolving conditions.
